# gray code class is complete

# todo handle the model generation
# define shape by layers and activation functions
# inherit style from TF
# weights and biases etc

# todo handle the matrix multiplication and addition
# just use numpy

# todo handle the inputs from the env and get them to be useful
# pass the input in, do the AI good good on it then use softmax to pick the best one

# todo add scoring, evolution and mating
# the scores from each will be given to the AI class
# the evolution will be easy because the AI will be stored as a fuck off large string of 0s and 1s
