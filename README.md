the features of this work
 - Very fundamental implementation of a **Binary Genetic Algorithm**
 - Full gene sequence stored in **8 bit gray code**
 - **Highly configurable NN** shape and activation functions
 - **Breading and genetic mutation** of off spring between the strongest parents
 - Remove from the population of the 'Weaker' agents
 - **Visualisation of the best agent** in the 'run best agent.py' script
 - Logging of metrics to '**Weights and Biases**', this includes:
    - a feature to enable **training resumption**
    - best score and average **score logging** for each eps
   
If you can't get it to work see here to see it in action (the best agent that was trained)
